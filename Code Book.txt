Code Book -- Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

Purpose: This code book is meant to provide a description of the variables included in the final summary table produced by running run_analysis.R. It also describes the steps taken to get from the variables and observations in the raw data to the variables and observations in the summary table.



Study Design:
------------

Source: The data come from the UCI HAR dataset on human activity recordings, which are provided as part of the assignment. Each observation in the original data set represents a single instance of one of thirty  subjects performing one of six activities. Each variable represents a value calculated from accelerometer and gyroscope recordings while the subject performed the activity. Additional information about these variables is below.

Summarization: To create the tidy data summary produced by run_analysis.R, the original raw data are amended in several ways. First, only means and standard deviations of accelerometer/gyroscope data are included. Additionally, measures of "mean frequency" were not included, as these seemed somewhat different from the requested means and standard deviations. Lastly, some variables included the word "body" twice (e.g. "fBodyBodyGyroJerkMag-std()"), and these were not clearly defined in the code book accompanying the raw data. Basically, I could not for the life of me come up with an appropriate variable name, so I dropped those too. The final data set contains 62 variables, described in more detail below.

In addition to excluding these variables, observations were also summarized, such that there is one recording per subject per activity, averaged across all the instances of the subject performing that activity. Thus, there are 180 rows in this summarized data set: 6 observations X 30 subjects.

Naming: Variables have been renamed from their original, less-tidy names in the raw data. The identification variables have been named Subject_ID and Activity_ID, respectively. The remaining variables have been given names which should be English descriptions of what the variable measures. Because these variable names contain a lot of information, the names are long and somewhat cumbersome. However, they are intended to demonstrate the tidy data requirement of being human-understandable. Hopefully they are quite clear. To be painstakingly diligent, I have listed descriptions below as well.



Varible Naming: 
--------------

While the two ID variables in the summary data set (Subject_ID and Activity_ID) are fairly straightforward, the other variables in this dataset can be quite confusing. Essentially, each variable represents some combination of the following options:

Fourier-Transformed: Some variables are non-transformed, and some have undergone a Fourier transformation.

Body vs. Gravity: Variables either reflect the forces due to a person moving ("bodily") or due to the constant pull of gravity ("gravitational").

Accelerometer vs. Gyroscope: Each recording comes from one of two recording instruments, either an accelerometer, or a gyroscope.

Jerk: Some variables just reflect the recordings from the instrument, others reflect a calculation of the "jerk" -- that is, the derivative of acceleration.

X, Y, Z, or magnitude: Each recording reflects EITHER a one directional component (in the X-, Y-, or Z- direction), OR the magnitude (as a scalar), calculated as the Euclidean norm of the X-, Y-, and Z- components.

Mean or SD: Finally, each variable is either a mean or a standard deviation of the many recordings which occured for a particular instance of a particular subject performing a particular activity.

Combining across these options (and including the two ID variables), the summary data set contains the following 62 variables. I have tried to make variable names as abundantly clear as possible, and I know that this section may look messy, but for the sake of the exercise, I wanted to explicitly list each variable with an accompanying definition. Here they are, with column numbers in brackets:
